She currently has a low skill ceiling and zero skillshots. With this rework I&amp;#39;m seeking to create a new sense of identity and a reason to pick her over other melee DPS champions, while giving people who play Fiora a chance to separate themselves as great players through use of her abilities and her new unique resource, Resolve. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Resource - Resolve:&lt;/strong&gt; Fiora&amp;#39;s resolve strengthens as she fatigues from prolonged combat, increasing the damage of her abilities while reducing her attack speed. Resolve builds while Fiora is in combat, dealing damage, and decays when out of combat at an accelerating rate. The rate of generation/loss scales with level, allowing her to more precisely manipulate encounters.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passive - Insight/Fatigue:&lt;/strong&gt; A lifetime of fencing has sharpened Fiora&amp;#39;s mind and body.  Her insight into her opponent&amp;#39;s attack patterns and openings grows, increasing the damage of her abilities. As she fights, her agile maneuvers fatigue her body, reducing the speed at which she strikes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concepts:&lt;/em&gt; Fencing involves constant intense movement and knowledge of your opponent&amp;#39;s strengths and weaknesses. As Fiora fights, she learns about her opponent; knowing when and how to strike to deal the most damage. As a balancing point to this, the strain from her acrobatic tactics reduces the rate at which she can strike as battles rage on.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes:&lt;/em&gt; Originally I thought that fatigue would reduce her auto-attack damage, but I felt that it didn&amp;#39;t quite fit given the circumstances. Still, it could be an easier thing to balance while still easily justifiable and could be used in place of the attack speed reduction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q - Lunge: *Straight-Line Skillshot, Low-to-Medium Range, Long Cooldown.&lt;/strong&gt;* Fiora lunges in a line, thrusting her foil with expert precision dealing &lt;em&gt;A/B/C/D/E Damage (AD Ratio)&lt;/em&gt;. Lunge deals damage based on the distance traveled &lt;em&gt;(starting at a value &amp;gt; 100% to X)&lt;/em&gt;. Striking an enemy champion with Lunge reduces the cooldown, striking a minion or monster reduces the cooldown by a lesser amount. Lunge generates &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; resolve and applies on-hit effects.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concepts:&lt;/em&gt; The Lunge is a classic offensive strike in fencing. It promotes forward, linear movement, and has a high-risk, high reward feel to it. The lunge should be Fiora&amp;#39;s main form of all-in attack, rewarding accuracy by refuding a large portion of the cooldown upon a successful connect. This cooldown refund could scale with either her Q level or R level to balance it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W - Feint:&lt;/strong&gt; Fiora enters a defensive stance for 1 second, and is unable to auto-attack during this time. If an enemy hits Fiora with an auto-attack or single target ability, Fiora blocks it and strikes back against her assailiant dealing &lt;em&gt;A/B/C/D/E (Magic? Physical?) Damage (? Ratio)&lt;/em&gt;. After striking back, Fiora gains a short movement speed buff &lt;em&gt;(A/B/C/D/E)&lt;/em&gt; and can activate Feint again in a short window to leap away from the target. Feint generates &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; resolve.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concepts:&lt;/em&gt; By giving Fiora a conditional defensive ability that also creates distance from her target, it cements the feeling of quick, hyper-efficient combat that fencing embodies. Locking her out of her auto-attacks forces her to choose the best time to feint wisely, as you would imagine. The movement speed is used as an assistant to the leap to make positioning feel good and rewarding. I also questioned whether or not Feint should apply on-hit effects but felt it would be too strong, given what it already offers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E - Beat Attacks/Remise:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Passive&lt;/em&gt; - Fiora&amp;#39;s unrelenting blows wear down her opponents. Her Lunge and Feint apply a &lt;em&gt;(A/B/C/D/E)&lt;/em&gt; movement speed debuff and &lt;em&gt;(A/B/C/D/E)&lt;/em&gt; armor shred to her targets. This debuff can stack twice &lt;em&gt;(Once for each)&lt;/em&gt;. Additional application of this debuff will only refresh the duration &lt;em&gt;(x)&lt;/em&gt; times.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Active&lt;/em&gt; - Fiora lashes out with astonishing speed, striking her opponent dealing &lt;em&gt;(A/B/C/D/E)&lt;/em&gt; damage &lt;em&gt;(AD Ratio)&lt;/em&gt; and dealing extra damage if the target has recently been affected by Feint.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concepts:&lt;/em&gt; I wanted to give Fiora some passive offensive stats, but avoid the big, balance limiting chunks of AD she currently gets. A foil should strike quickly and with precision, so it makes sense that this stat be Armor Shred. The synergies here are obvious, it&amp;#39;s an auto-attack reset and rewards proper use of her Feint in an offensive way, mitigating some of the DPS loss from being locked out of your auto-attack. Also, it gives her some small form of soft CC which she otherwise (for good reason) completely lacks, and is separate from her other abilities giving her a more smooth power curve/level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultimate - Blade Waltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Fiora gathers her resolve for a dizzying dance of strikes which sweeps her across the battlefield. Blade Waltz deals &lt;em&gt;(A/B/C)&lt;/em&gt; physical damage &lt;em&gt;(AD Ratio)&lt;/em&gt; to all targets in a given area, scaling with her Resolve. If Fiora runs out of targets before finishing her Blade Waltz, it ends and a portion of the cooldown is refunded &lt;em&gt;(based on duration remaining).&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concepts:&lt;/em&gt; Blade Waltz has always been a point of contention with Fiora. Thematically, it&amp;#39;s a really cool and strong feeling ability. In practice, it&amp;#39;s frustrating to balance and play against since it entirely lacks counterplay. By changing it from a single target ability to an AoE, it gives opponents a chance to flee before being cut to ribbons. In my vision of Blade Waltz, Fiora is targetable but dashing quickly in a pre-defined pattern &lt;em&gt;(Up, Down, Left, Right Konami anyone?)&lt;/em&gt; making it difficult, but possible to counter &lt;em&gt;(Think Zed, Yasuo).&lt;/em&gt; Furthermore, it rewards proper timing to a Fiora who goes in after all CC has been blown after darting in and out of the fight to clean up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Closing Thoughts:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is my first time doing a Champion Concept, so I&amp;#39;m not going to throw out absurd-looking values. Rather, I&amp;#39;m trying to re-define what it means to play as Fiora. Personally, I feel that her current state is rather disappointing given the potential. Now we&amp;#39;ve seen great thematic champions such as Gnar, Yasuo, Zed, and Rek&amp;#39;Sai and I think Fiora can achieve that too. Fiora should be the Grand Duelist, darting in and out of the fray before dashing in, weaving through enemies to stab at the heart of their team and do a little more than Double-cast her Q, Ulti, and hope to follow up by right clicking until everyone&amp;#39;s screen is gray. Any input would be greatly appreciated! (Especially from Fiora mains. Hello?

She currently has a low skill ceiling and zero skillshots. With this rework I'm seeking to create a new sense of identity and a reason to pick her over other melee DPS champions, while giving people who play Fiora a chance to separate themselves as great players through use of her abilities and her new unique resource, Resolve. \n   \n**Unique Resource - Resolve:** Fiora's resolve strengthens as she fatigues from prolonged combat, increasing the damage of her abilities while reducing her attack speed. Resolve builds while Fiora is in combat, dealing damage, and decays when out of combat at an accelerating rate. The rate of generation/loss scales with level, allowing her to more precisely manipulate encounters.  \n  \n**Passive - Insight/Fatigue:** A lifetime of fencing has sharpened Fiora's mind and body.

I feel like a treatise on buying vs. building and all associated considerations should be added to the stickied post on building and selecting components, added to the FAQ, or otherwise made available. The following is my initial take on the subject. I apologize if this is covered elsewhere, if I am missing important information, if I am under any false understanding, and for any terminological/grammatical/typographical errors. Please let me know if you would like anything added to this, anything changed, or if I should delete post and weep over the time spent :) (jk, it was fun to kill time during boring meetings)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;\u201cBuild\u201d Defined:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following are 4 general build examples. There are many variations on level of effort and the applicability of any given part (some parts are non-essential like muzzle devices, butt stocks on pistol builds, some builds will be piston driven so the parts list does not apply, etc). These serve as examples and not rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50/50.&lt;/strong&gt; A 50/50 build is where you purchase a complete lower assembly including lower (DROSed part), Lower Parts Kit (LPK), Buffer assembly, stock, pistol grip, etc. and a complete upper assembly including barrel, muzzle device, gas block, gas tube, handguard, barrel nut, upper receiver, Forward assist, port door, charging handle, and complete BCG. You then assemble the rifle. This is the lowest level of effort build. Any easier, and you are just buying a complete rifle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical build.&lt;/strong&gt; Often, AR builders will assemble the lower half from a stripped lower and then purchase (and customize if necessary) an upper. This necessitates installation of the Fire Control Group (FCG) and all other lower parts in the LPK. Additionally, the buffer assembly and stock will be installed. Assuming the LPK included a pistol grip, the lower is now complete. From here, the builder can buy a complete upper and install.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rifle Kit.&lt;/strong&gt; Essentially the same as a typical build but simpler in terms of purchasing. There are several retailers that will sell a \u201cRifle kit\u201d that includes everything needed for a complete rifle with the exception of a stripped lower. This requires all of the same assembly as a typical build, but there are less decisions to make in terms of parts selection.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete build.&lt;/strong&gt; A complete build would be assembly of the entire rifle from individual parts. This is the highest level of effort build. A decision, purchase, and installation must be made for every single part. \nOnce any build is complete, modifications can always be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Build vs. Buy&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following are some of the main considerations in deciding whether you want to build or buy.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost.&lt;/strong&gt; If low cost is your main value, then the following are rough approximate costs with buffers built in so you may be able to find lower prices here and there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build:&lt;/strong&gt; Rifle kit ($500), stripped lower ($100), DROS/Tax/Shipping ($85). Total for the build option is ($685). Places to look for savings in this scenario are sales and closeouts, ordering from out of state can save taxes, and sourcing your lower from private parties or doing an 80% lower or purchasing a polymer lower can all be potential sources of savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy:&lt;/strong&gt; Obviously here, prices can vary by retailer, location, brand etc. So the following are some of the most readily available examples. All of the following may have shipping/tax/DROS fees associated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cabelas.com has the DPMS &lt;a href=\"http://www.cabelas.com/product/Shooting/Firearms/Centerfire-Rifles/Semiautomatic-Centerfire-Rifles%7C/pc/104792580/c/553829580/sc/105522480/i/105524280/DPMS174-Oracle8482-Semiautomatic-Tactical-Rifles/1143595.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse%2Fsemiautomatic-centerfire-rifles%2F_%2FN-1114861%2FNs-CATEGORY_SEQ_105524280%3FWTz_l%3DSBC%253BMMcat104792580%253Bcat105522480&amp;amp;WTz_l=SBC%3BMMcat104792580%3Bcat105522480%3Bcat105524280\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; rifle for $699.00.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.basspro.com/Cartridge-or-Gauge-223-5-56-NATO/Cartridge-or-Gauge-223-Remington/Shooting-Guns-Rifles/Type-Centerfire-Rifle/_/N-1z0vajaZ1z0vjnqZ1z0ux62Z1z0vcl4\"&gt;Bass Pro&lt;/a&gt; has Bushmaster and CMMG AR-15s for $899.00.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Many Wal-Marts carry the Colt 6920 for about $900.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Atlantic Arms has an &lt;a href=\"https://www.atlanticfirearms.com/ar15-rifles.html\"&gt;Olympic Arms&lt;/a&gt; rifle for $599 (Regular $649)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as you can see, you can buy a complete firearm for slightly more money if you just want a working AR for the least dollars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time.&lt;/strong&gt; If time is your main value, go to your local gun shop, Wal-Mart, Basspro, Cabela\u2019s, Dick\u2019s, or other Sporting goods store. If you live in a \u201cfree\u201d state (not california, you will be able to walk out with a rifle and shoot all night. If you have a little patience, order online and select expedited shipping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost:Time Ratio.&lt;/strong&gt; If you would like to spread cost over time, building is a great option. When I was a college student, I took 2 years to complete my first AR build by spending $40 here, $15 there, and $100 on other things. In the end I probably over paid, but my wallet didn\u2019t notice it as much as if I plopped $800 in one shot. Secondly, if your ultimate goal is a premium AR-15 with all the best components, but you also wish to get shooting early, you can buy the entry level AR and customize over time. You could buy a Del-Ton rifle for $700, and one part at a time convert it to an SPR, 3-Gun, 1000yd Precision gun, SBR, Class III-Full auto-suppressed sexy time build, etc. As with the first example, the end cost will be larger, but you can start with a $700 investment and end with a rifle that would have cost $3000 to buy; all the while shooting it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customization.&lt;/strong&gt; If customization is your goal, then building is the way to go. You want a specific lower, and a certain trigger, and all matching furniture in that limited edition color from X manufacturer\u2026you won\u2019t find this on a shelf. If you do find it on a shelf, refer to the section on Cost and make your decision based on dollars. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Laws.&lt;/strong&gt; This will be a unique consideration for each state. I\u2019ll give a couple examples. Additionally, there are many many convoluted workarounds that some may be comfortable with and some may not. 1) I live in California where we have a \u201cSafe Handgun Roster\u201d. Therefore if I want to buy an AR pistol, it must be one that has been submitted by the manufacturer for evaluation by the state (Very Short List). Also, it is illegal to sell a lower receiver as a pistol, therefore conventional building will not do either. One option is to buy an 80% lower, finish, and build. This is the option I chose. 2) In California, there are fixed magazine (Bullet Button) rifles and Featureless (no pistol grip, FH, collapsible stock, VFG) rifles. To buy a complete rifle it needs to be in one of these configurations. The majority of manufacturers have limited or no options for us\u2026therefore I build at least on a 50/50 basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building gives you the opportunity to save costs, customize, spread cost over time, and possibly work around laws. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying gives you the opportunity to save costs (if you are getting exactly what you want off the shelf), shoot ASAP, requires less effort, and requires less decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "There are many people coming to this forum asking for advice on whether they should buy or build an AR.

This requires all of the same assembly as a typical build, but there are less decisions to make in terms of parts selection.  \n\n* **Complete build.** A complete build would be assembly of the entire rifle from individual parts. This is the highest level of effort build. A decision, purchase, and installation must be made for every single part. \nOnce any build is complete, modifications can always be made.\n\n***\n\n\n###Build vs. Buy\n\nThe following are some of the main considerations in deciding whether you want to build or buy.    \n\n**Cost.** If low cost is your main value, then the following are rough approximate costs with buffers built in so you may be able to find lower prices here and there.\n\n* **Build:** Rifle kit ($500), stripped lower ($100), DROS/Tax/Shipping ($85). Total for the build option is ($685). Places to look for savings in this scenario are sales and closeouts, ordering from out of state can save taxes, and sourcing your lower from private parties or doing an 80% lower or purchasing a polymer lower can all be potential sources of savings.\n\n* **Buy:** Obviously here, prices can vary by retailer, location, brand etc. So the following are some of the most readily available examples. All of the following may have shipping/tax/DROS fees associated.\n\n    * Cabelas.com has the DPMS [Oracle]( http://www.cabelas.com/product/Shooting/Firearms/Centerfire-Rifles/Semiautomatic-Centerfire-Rifles|/pc/104792580/c/553829580/sc/105522480/i/105524280/DPMS174-Oracle8482-Semiautomatic-Tactical-Rifles/1143595.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse%2Fsemiautomatic-centerfire-rifles%2F_%2FN-1114861%2FNs-CATEGORY_SEQ_105524280%3FWTz_l%3DSBC%253BMMcat104792580%253Bcat105522480&amp;WTz_l=SBC%3BMMcat104792580%3Bcat105522480%3Bcat105524280) rifle for $699.00.\n\n    * [Bass Pro]( http://www.basspro.com/Cartridge-or-Gauge-223-5-56-NATO/Cartridge-or-Gauge-223-Remington/Shooting-Guns-Rifles/Type-Centerfire-Rifle/_/N-1z0vajaZ1z0vjnqZ1z0ux62Z1z0vcl4) has Bushmaster and CMMG AR-15s for $899.00.\n\n    * Many Wal-Marts carry the Colt 6920 for about $900.\n    * Atlantic Arms has an [Olympic Arms](https://www.atlanticfirearms.com/ar15-rifles.html) rifle for $599 (Regular $649)\n\nSo as you can see, you can buy a complete firearm for slightly more money if you just want a working AR for the least dollars.\n\n**Time.** If time is your main value, go to your local gun shop, Wal-Mart, Basspro, Cabela\u2019s, Dick\u2019s, or other Sporting goods store. If you live in a \u201cfree\u201d state (not california, you will be able to walk out with a rifle and shoot all night. If you have a little patience, order online and select expedited shipping.\n\n**Cost:Time Ratio.** If you would like to spread cost over time, building is a great option. When I was a college student, I took 2 years to complete my first AR build by spending $40 here, $15 there, and $100 on other things. In the end I probably over paid, but my wallet didn\u2019t notice it as much as if I plopped $800 in one shot. Secondly, if your ultimate goal is a premium AR-15 with all the best components, but you also wish to get shooting early, you can buy the entry level AR and customize over time. You could buy a Del-Ton rifle for $700, and one part at a time convert it to an SPR, 3-Gun, 1000yd Precision gun, SBR, Class III-Full auto-suppressed sexy time build, etc. As with the first example, the end cost will be larger, but you can start with a $700 investment and end with a rifle that would have cost $3000 to buy; all the while shooting it regularly.\n\n\n**Customization.** If customization is your goal, then building is the way to go. You want a specific lower, and a certain trigger, and all matching furniture in that limited edition color from X manufacturer\u2026you won\u2019t find this on a shelf. If you do find it on a shelf, refer to the section on Cost and make your decision based on dollars. \n\n**Local Laws.** This will be a unique consideration for each state. I\u2019ll give a couple examples. Additionally, there are many many convoluted workarounds that some may be comfortable with and some may not. 1) I live in California where we have a \u201cSafe Handgun Roster\u201d. Therefore if I want to buy an AR pistol, it must be one that has been submitted by the manufacturer for evaluation by the state (Very Short List). Also, it is illegal to sell a lower receiver as a pistol, therefore conventional building will not do either. One option is to buy an 80% lower, finish, and build. This is the option I chose. 2) In California, there are fixed magazine (Bullet Button) rifles and Featureless (no pistol grip, FH, collapsible stock, VFG) rifles. To buy a complete rifle it needs to be in one of these configurations. The majority of manufacturers have limited or no options for us\u2026therefore I build at least on a 50/50 basis.\n\n***\n\n\nTL;DR: \n\n* Building gives you the opportunity to save costs, customize, spread cost over time, and possibly work around laws. \n\n* Buying gives you the opportunity to save costs (if you are getting exactly what you want off the shelf), shoot ASAP, requires less effort, and requires less decisions. \n", "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "2rs8cn", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nreyes238", "media": null, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh23", "edited": 1420751940.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "mod_reports": [], "saved": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_2rs8cn", "permalink": "/r/test/comments/2rs8cn/test/", "stickied": false, "created": 1420780419.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/test/comments/2rs8cn/test/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "**Test**", "created_utc": 1420751619.0, "ups": 1, "num_comments": 0, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.test", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "test", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tacoit&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Tacoit", "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "2rrw79", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tickles_My_Pickles", "media": null, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh23", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "mod_reports": [], "saved": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_2rrw79", "permalink": "/r/test/comments/2rrw79/test/", "stickied": false, "created": 1420774997.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/test/comments/2rrw79/test/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Test", "created_utc": 1420746197.0, "ups": 1, "num_comments": 0, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.test", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "test", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "2rrifm", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "preemium", "media": null, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh23", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "mod_reports": [], "saved": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_2rrifm", "permalink": "/r/test/comments/2rrifm/testtest/", "stickied": false, "created": 1420768676.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/test/comments/2rrifm/testtest/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "testtest", "created_utc": 1420739876.0, "ups": 1, "num_comments": 0, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.test", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "test", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey things have happened and i needed to share my feelings thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 20 year old male and few years ago my then girlfriend left me for another man, at the time i thought she would be the one that i would spend my whole life with.

I had been playing 5|0  blitz for a few months on chess.com. During this time I read some books, watched some video analysis of openings and games, followed this sub for tips and such, etc... I had been fluctuating between 700 and 800 for most of that time. I set a goal for myself that I would reach 1000. I got it and within a week or two I peaked around 1080 and was eventually back down to the mid 800s again. I wasn&amp;#39;t exactly disheartened by this. When I was heading for my goal I was playing more seriously than I guess others do. After I got it and was satisfied that I have the ability to take what I&amp;#39;ve learned and apply it, I played in a more relaxed way. I&amp;#39;ll try again to improve my blitz game eventually, but for now my goal is to improve my over all game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The universal suggestion for improvement is to play longer games. This makes sense to me, and it should make sense to everybody. Ideally one would have the ability to play longer live games online and perhaps join a club. At this point in my life I can&amp;#39;t play more than a 5|0 online and joining a club any time soon seems doubtful as well. This leaves me with correspondence chess. I play on chess.com and am also giving the lichess correspondence a shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been doing this for at least two months by now. I don&amp;#39;t know that my game has improved all that much, but I feel like I have a better understanding of the games. Certainly I&amp;#39;m getting better an not hanging pieces in the opening. Whatever the results, I feel like I&amp;#39;m getting something out of it and I&amp;#39;m having fun with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I didn&amp;#39;t think for a second that I&amp;#39;d suddenly be good at 5|0. It&amp;#39;s a whole different mindset and different skills are emphasized. However, I was unprepared for how uneasy I would feel playing it at first. I&amp;#39;m going to post this, and I&amp;#39;m cringing already. I included some quick thoughts to share, but I&amp;#39;m definitely going to take a long look at this. The game itself probably isn&amp;#39;t that complicated. What I want to evaluate now is if this is the type of game I&amp;#39;ve always played in 5|0, or if I&amp;#39;m just now starting to understand the game well enough to see how ugly I&amp;#39;ve been playing all along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[pgn][White &amp;quot;Gurana&amp;quot;]\n[Black &amp;quot;**********&amp;quot;]\n[Result &amp;quot;1-0&amp;quot;]\n[WhiteElo &amp;quot;862&amp;quot;]\n[BlackElo &amp;quot;901&amp;quot;]\n[Termination &amp;quot;White won by checkmate&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.b3 e5\n{Really not a great opening, but it ends up not being that bad at my rating... I&amp;#39;m fine with that, except I seldom play it in correspondence and hence haven&amp;#39;t played it in a while.}\n2.Bb2 Bc5\n3.Nf3\n{OK. So a common thing I look after when I&amp;#39;ve moved Bb2 in this opening is an early dark square bishop move by black. Undefends the g7 pawn and if the knight hasn&amp;#39;t moved I can sometimes get the rook. This seems way early to me. Considered 3. Bxe5 f6, then I&amp;#39;ve lost a tempo for a pawn. I&amp;#39;d normally be ok with that, but thought I&amp;#39;d go for what seemd like a more principled developing move.}\n3.   ... Bxf2+?\n{I had seen that and thought, &amp;quot;Never happen... takes away my right to castle and exposes the king, but with no other pieces developed that would be a bad move for black.&amp;quot; Computer says this position is +2, so perhaps I was right.}\n4.Kxf2 e4??\n{So Black just opened the door for me to grab the rook. And since he sacked his dark square bishop, there probably isn&amp;#39;t an easy way to trap my dark square bishop afterwards, which sometimes happens. I&amp;#39;m proud that the thought occured to me to at least pretend to calculate the continuation, but really I was moving forward with that plan anyways. I got as far as 5. Bxg7 exf3 6. Bxh8, um... and more moves from here. What was clear to me was I was going to get a rook and it would cost me a knight. I was cool with that.}\n5.Bxg7 exf3\n6.Bxh8 fxg2\n{It wasn&amp;#39;t until just now that I remembered something that took me a while to figure out when I was starting off. I don&amp;#39;t have to take the rook right away! That rook is trapped and there probably weren&amp;#39;t any tactics to immediately take back, so why not play 6. gxf3 here? Don&amp;#39;t have to take until the rook becomes untrapped really. I liked gxf3 over exf3 because I thought I&amp;#39;d like to get my light squared bishop on the long diagonal. Also, seems like you&amp;#39;re supposed to take towards the center by default. When I look at it now I think exf3 was probably better. gxf3 doesn&amp;#39;t really give my light square bishop access to the long diagonal without f4, and who knows when/if that would ever happen?

I had been playing 5|0  blitz for a few months on chess.com. During this time I read some books, watched some video analysis of openings and games, followed this sub for tips and such, etc... I had been fluctuating between 700 and 800 for most of that time. I set a goal for myself that I would reach 1000. I got it and within a week or two I peaked around 1080 and was eventually back down to the mid 800s again. I wasn't exactly disheartened by this. When I was heading for my goal I was playing more seriously than I guess others do. After I got it and was satisfied that I have the ability to take what I've learned and apply it, I played in a more relaxed way. I'll try again to improve my blitz game eventually, but for now my goal is to improve my over all game. \n\nThe universal suggestion for improvement is to play longer games. This makes sense to me, and it should make sense to everybody. Ideally one would have the ability to play longer live games online and perhaps join a club. At this point in my life I can't play more than a 5|0 online and joining a club any time soon seems doubtful as well. This leaves me with correspondence chess. I play on chess.com and am also giving the lichess correspondence a shot.\n\nI've been doing this for at least two months by now. I don't know that my game has improved all that much, but I feel like I have a better understanding of the games. Certainly I'm getting better an not hanging pieces in the opening. Whatever the results, I feel like I'm getting something out of it and I'm having fun with it.\n\nNow, I didn't think for a second that I'd suddenly be good at 5|0. It's a whole different mindset and different skills are emphasized. However, I was unprepared for how uneasy I would feel playing it at first. I'm going to post this, and I'm cringing already. I included some quick thoughts to share, but I'm definitely going to take a long look at this. The game itself probably isn't that complicated. What I want to evaluate now is if this is the type of game I've always played in 5|0, or if I'm just now starting to understand the game well enough to see how ugly I've been playing all along.\n\n[pgn][White \"Gurana\"]\n[Black \"**********\"]\n[Result \"1-0\"]\n[WhiteElo \"862\"]\n[BlackElo \"901\"]\n[Termination \"White won by checkmate\"]\n\n1.b3 e5\n{Really not a great opening, but it ends up not being that bad at my rating... I'm fine with that, except I seldom play it in correspondence and hence haven't played it in a while.}\n2.Bb2 Bc5\n3.Nf3\n{OK. So a common thing I look after when I've moved Bb2 in this opening is an early dark square bishop move by black. Undefends the g7 pawn and if the knight hasn't moved I can sometimes get the rook. This seems way early to me. Considered 3. Bxe5 f6, then I've lost a tempo for a pawn. I'd normally be ok with that, but thought I'd go for what seemd like a more principled developing move.}\n3.   ... Bxf2+?\n{I had seen that and thought, \"Never happen... takes away my right to castle and exposes the king, but with no other pieces developed that would be a bad move for black.\" Computer says this position is +2, so perhaps I was right.}\n4.Kxf2 e4??\n{So Black just opened the door for me to grab the rook. And since he sacked his dark square bishop, there probably isn't an easy way to trap my dark square bishop afterwards, which sometimes happens. I'm proud that the thought occured to me to at least pretend to calculate the continuation, but really I was moving forward with that plan anyways. I got as far as 5. Bxg7 exf3 6. Bxh8, um... and more moves from here. What was clear to me was I was going to get a rook and it would cost me a knight. I was cool with that.}\n5.Bxg7 exf3\n6.Bxh8 fxg2\n{It wasn't until just now that I remembered something that took me a while to figure out when I was starting off. I don't have to take the rook right away! That rook is trapped and there probably weren't any tactics to immediately take back, so why not play 6. gxf3 here? Don't have to take until the rook becomes untrapped really. I liked gxf3 over exf3 because I thought I'd like to get my light squared bishop on the long diagonal. Also, seems like you're supposed to take towards the center by default. When I look at it now I think exf3 was probably better. gxf3 doesn't really give my light square bishop access to the long diagonal without f4, and who knows when/if that would ever happen?

I figured that quite a few new people to Smite as well as people who might not follow competitive Smite may very well be watching the Smite World Championship this weekend. To help those players I am going to provide a &amp;#39;relatively&amp;#39; short guide on the basics that you might want to know going into this weekend. I am also going to be using some terminology in this mini-guide and while I will do my best to explain, if a word catches you that you don&amp;#39;t understand check out this resource : &lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Common_Terms\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Common_Terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smite is 3rd person MOBA where you are down on the battlefield in the Action. You play Gods from different Pantheons around the world with the goal of destroying the enemy &lt;strong&gt;Titan&lt;/strong&gt;. Each team consists of 5 players who will need to work together to defeat enemy gods, kill monsters in the jungle area for buffs, and push into the enemy base to win the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each God has a passive and 4 abilities at their disposal to use. Their 4th ability is their &amp;#39;Ultimate&amp;#39; which is generally a much more powerful skill than the rest on a longer cooldown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each God can also be broken down into 1 of 5 different &amp;#39;classes&amp;#39;. Mages, Assassins, Guardians, Warriors, and Hunters. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mages are your spell casters that generally have high magical damage burst abilities, while also being pretty low in Survivability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assassins are generally high burst, high mobility, and low survivability physical damage dealers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guardians are your Tanks. They have incredible survivability and generally come equipped with lots of Crowd Control. (Stuns, Taunts, Knockups, Slows, ect.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Warriors are your slightly tankier Melee front liners. They will be naturally tanky (but not as much as Tanks) and can deal our quite a bit of damage. Expect them to be in fights constantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hunters are your ranged carries. These are your characters that love to sit in the back and poke people down with high damaging in-hands (The term used for basic attacks in this game.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Map&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The map has 3 lanes, the &amp;#39;short&amp;#39; lane, the middle lane, and the &amp;#39;long&amp;#39; lane. When looking at &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/hT2EgqT\"&gt;The Map&lt;/a&gt; the short and long lanes are determined by the distance between towers. The left lane in this picture is the &amp;#39;long&amp;#39; lane as the 2 closest towers are quite a ways away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each lane has 2 towers to defeat and a Phoenix to destroy to allow the Titan to be vulnerable to attack. Phoenix&amp;#39;s are unique as when they are defeated the minions from the team that destroyed it in that lane will be Fire Minions, making them stronger in all respects. Phoenix&amp;#39;s also respawn after a set amount of time allowing for teams to recover if they can hold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The areas in-between lanes are known as the jungle. This is where teams will kill monsters that spawn for experience, gold, and buffs that provide benefits to a player. The three buffs are as follows -&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speed Buff : This is the Orange Buff that is on the map. This provides Movement Speed and Attack Speed to the holder. This is regarded as the best buff in the Map.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Damage Buff : This is the Red Buff that is on the map. This provides a large % increase to your magical or physical power. This generally goes towards your Mage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mana Buff : This is the Blue Buff that is on the map. This provides the player with a large increase to Mana Regen and some Cooldown Reduction. Cooldown Reduction lowers the cooldown on your abilities. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fire Giant Buff : This is the Fire icon near the short lane. This in the buff that ends games. When the Fire Giant is defeated it provides all players on a team with a huge increase to damage, and regen, as well as damage to structures. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other camps are the Harpy camps. The one that mirrors the Fire Giant is a Golden Harpy (Refered as the Gold Fury in game) that provides a HUGE amount of gold to the team that defeats it. This is the objective that most early and mid game team fights revolve around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Grey Harpy camps are quickly respawning sources of Gold and Experience for whomever clears it. The middle ones are considered a small objective, and teams will likely be fighting over them every time they respawn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The respawn rates for these camps are 5 minutes for the Fire Giant and Gold Fury. 4 Minutes for the rest of the buffs, 3 minutes for the middle harpies, and 2 minutes for harpies nearest to each base. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Meta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those newer to MOBA style games there is generally something reffered to as &amp;#39;The Meta&amp;#39; which simply means : &amp;quot;What strategy are people using to win the match&amp;quot;. It generally discusses how many gods to a lane, do we use a jungler, and which gods go where.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smite uses a 2 - 1 - 1 - Jungler type setup. The long lane gets a Support (Guardian/Warrior) and a Carry (Hunter/Few Mages). The middle lane is almost exclusively Mages. The Short Lane gets a Solo Laner (Warrior/Mages/Few Assassins) and the Jungler who will spend most of the game killing Jungle Camps (Almost always an Assassins, few mages/warriors).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This setup allows for a few things, and these will be things you want to watch out for. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Long Lane (The Duo Lane) : &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This lane exists because the Support will help the Hunter who is generally weak early on get on his feet. You can expect every 3 minutes the Support Player to leave to help the Mid Lane and the Jungler to fight over the Mid Harpies. Be on the lookout for the Hunter to be crazy Late Game (20+ Minutes in).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Mid Lane :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mid lane is going to be about two mages fighting eachother for minion farm. Expect them to clear the minions quickly and to be looking for chances to rotate to the side lanes for surprise kills. They will also be with the support and jungler every three minutes fighting over mid harpies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Solo Lane :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is generally referred to as &amp;#39;Solo Island&amp;#39;. Most of the time this lane will result in few kills and be mostly a farm lane. The only time Solo Laners leave is to fight over the &amp;#39;main&amp;#39; objectives such as tower pushes, Gold Fury, or even Fire Giant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jungle :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The jungler has the role of farming the jungle for his experience as well as providing support and ganks (rotating to lanes to try to get kills) for his team. They provide uncertainty for the enemy team as he might be anywhere. Expect him to be at every major objective as well as every mid harpies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A standard match with each team taking one of the mid harpy camps, getting blue for their Hunter and Solo laner, and for one of the junglers (the one on the &amp;#39;chaos&amp;#39; side of the map) their Speed Buff. After that players will be looking for chances to get farm and get kills in lane. Every Three Minutes expect to see some people head back to the Mid Harpies to fight over them. This is where you generally see &amp;#39;First Blood&amp;#39; (First Blood is the first death in the game, and this provides large bonus to whomever gets it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the early game comes to a close (8-12 Minutes) you can expect to see towers start falling, teams begin grouping for Gold Fury, and this is where you will see one team likely begin to take a lead (Although there are lots of ways for teams to come back as long as a lead doesn&amp;#39;t get too big.).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Mid Game is about really looking to continue accruing a lead through Gold Furies, Towers, Kills, and stealing farm away from the opposing team by taking Jungle Camps. This phase of the game is all about putting a team in a great position to take Fire Giant. Fire Giants will generally occur towards the end of Mid Game (18-22 Minutes) and after a fight where one team kills most of the other team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Late Game is really anything past 22 Minutes, and is denoted when everyone has most of their core items built, Inner Towers are getting pressured hard, and fights end with many deaths rather than one or two. Expect the game to end on one team getting a large win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is very much a simplified version of how a match can go, and some games can even go on for as long as 45+ Minutes, but this gives a solid road map to follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Gods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not going to cover every god but I will give not on a few you are likely going to see in each role.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thor&lt;/strong&gt; : Jungler - Very High Damage and Mobility, Thor&amp;#39;s ultimate is incredibly game changing. He can fly into the air and crash down on a location relatively far away from his take off location. This gives him the power to be everywhere and engage fights and because of this he is picked by a lot of teams. &lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Thor\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Thor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ra&lt;/strong&gt; : Mage (Solo/Mid) - High Damage, Long Range, Healer, Ra has a few things going for him. Good wave clear, a strong early game, a heal for his team that will make extended engagements goes in his favor, and an ultimate that is both great at engaging fights and picking off stragglers. &lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Ra\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Ra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apollo&lt;/strong&gt; : Hunter (Duo Lane) - Mobile, Hard To Kill, Late Game Carry, Apollo is probably the strongest Hunter in the game at the moment. His Ultimate will allow him to fly around the map getting to any teamfight he needs to, he can dash and CC enemies, and his passive allows him to put out the pain late game. Expect to see him picked or banned most of the time. &lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Apollo\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Apollo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vamana&lt;/strong&gt; : Warrior (Solo Lane) - Tanky, Hard to Stop, Vamana can charge into fights, become a Giant and then begin smashing into the enemy teams backline with little an enemy team can do about it. His ultimate gives him a lot of damage in an AoE and if Vamana isn&amp;#39;t stopped early this can destroy the late game. Vamana almost always makes a large splash at LANs. &lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Vamana\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Vamana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geb&lt;/strong&gt; : Guardian (Duo Lane) - Fast, Lots of CC, Cleanse, Geb is probably the top support right now (Next to Sylvanus &lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Sylvanus\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Sylvanus&lt;/a&gt;). Not only is he fast at getting around the map as he can roll to any location he needs to, but he provides a low cooldown knockup (the strongest CC), a shield that breaks CC for his allies, but a very powerful initiating Ultimate. While he can&amp;#39;t do much on his own, in a team he can quickly skew a fight in his favor. &lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Geb\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Geb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Gods to Note&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Janus\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Janus&lt;/a&gt; - Mage (Solo/Mid)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Hercules\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Hercules&lt;/a&gt; - Warrior (Solo)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Rama\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Rama&lt;/a&gt; - Hunter (Duo)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Anhur\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Anhur&lt;/a&gt; - Hunter (Duo)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Scylla\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Scylla&lt;/a&gt; - Mage (Mid)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Zhong_Kui\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Zhong_Kui&lt;/a&gt; - Mage (Solo/Mid)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Sylvanus\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Sylvanus&lt;/a&gt; - Guardian (Duo)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Serqet\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Serqet&lt;/a&gt; - Assassin (Jungle)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Loki\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Loki&lt;/a&gt; - Assassin (Jungle/Solo)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/Aphrodite\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; - Mage (Solo)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Items To Note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most items are character Specific and for that I am going to defer to the casting and analysts of the event to go over most of them but a few things to note for new players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Boots are very quick to be bought on all characters. They provide mobility and a good chunk of damage.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Actives in this game as abilities you can purchase and are incredibly strong.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Junglers and Supports are going to rush buying an active called Hand Of The Gods at the start of the game. This allows them to clear jungle camps and minions easily. Why this is super important to note is that when the game progresses to the mid game all Support players will have this item at Rank 3. This allows them to &amp;#39;execute&amp;#39; the Gold Fury and Fire Giant, and without it a team essentially can not risk attempting those objectives unless everyone is dead, as it might be stolen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Purification Beads are the other active you will commonly see. Crowd Control in this game is very powerful, and not only does Beads allow you to break Crowd Control, but on Mages/Assassins it will lower your cooldowns by 5 seconds, allowing for some characters to destroy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ending Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am hoping everyone enjoys the event, the entire staff has been working like crazy to ensure this event is a fantastic one, and the community out pour of support has been insane. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For further information or to look up more about the game on your own I would suggest &lt;a href=\"http://smite.gamepedia.com/\"&gt;http://smite.gamepedia.com/&lt;/a&gt; as your go to source. It is community managed and has a LOT of information that can be helpful during the event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For information about the event itself check out &lt;a href=\"http://www.hirezstudios.com/smite/promo/smite-world-championship\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; and you can watch all the action starting Janurary 9th on &lt;a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/smitegame\"&gt;www.twitch.tv/smitegame&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey Guys! I figured that quite a few new people to Smite as well as people who might not follow competitive Smite may very well be watching the Smite World Championship this weekend.

I am also going to be using some terminology in this mini-guide and while I will do my best to explain, if a word catches you that you don't understand check out this resource : http://smite.gamepedia.com/Common_Terms\n\n**The Game**\n\nSmite is 3rd person MOBA where you are down on the battlefield in the Action. You play Gods from different Pantheons around the world with the goal of destroying the enemy **Titan**. Each team consists of 5 players who will need to work together to defeat enemy gods, kill monsters in the jungle area for buffs, and push into the enemy base to win the game.\n\nEach God has a passive and 4 abilities at their disposal to use. Their 4th ability is their 'Ultimate' which is generally a much more powerful skill than the rest on a longer cooldown.\n\nEach God can also be broken down into 1 of 5 different 'classes'. Mages, Assassins, Guardians, Warriors, and Hunters. \n\nMages are your spell casters that generally have high magical damage burst abilities, while also being pretty low in Survivability.\n\nAssassins are generally high burst, high mobility, and low survivability physical damage dealers. \n\nGuardians are your Tanks. They have incredible survivability and generally come equipped with lots of Crowd Control. (Stuns, Taunts, Knockups, Slows, ect.) \n\nWarriors are your slightly tankier Melee front liners. They will be naturally tanky (but not as much as Tanks) and can deal our quite a bit of damage. Expect them to be in fights constantly.\n\nHunters are your ranged carries. These are your characters that love to sit in the back and poke people down with high damaging in-hands (The term used for basic attacks in this game.)\n\n**The Map**\n\nThe map has 3 lanes, the 'short' lane, the middle lane, and the 'long' lane. When looking at [The Map](http://imgur.com/hT2EgqT) the short and long lanes are determined by the distance between towers. The left lane in this picture is the 'long' lane as the 2 closest towers are quite a ways away.\n\nEach lane has 2 towers to defeat and a Phoenix to destroy to allow the Titan to be vulnerable to attack. Phoenix's are unique as when they are defeated the minions from the team that destroyed it in that lane will be Fire Minions, making them stronger in all respects. Phoenix's also respawn after a set amount of time allowing for teams to recover if they can hold.\n\nThe areas in-between lanes are known as the jungle. This is where teams will kill monsters that spawn for experience, gold, and buffs that provide benefits to a player. The three buffs are as follows -\n*****\nSpeed Buff : This is the Orange Buff that is on the map. This provides Movement Speed and Attack Speed to the holder. This is regarded as the best buff in the Map.\n\nDamage Buff : This is the Red Buff that is on the map. This provides a large % increase to your magical or physical power. This generally goes towards your Mage.\n\nMana Buff : This is the Blue Buff that is on the map. This provides the player with a large increase to Mana Regen and some Cooldown Reduction. Cooldown Reduction lowers the cooldown on your abilities. \n\nFire Giant Buff : This is the Fire icon near the short lane. This in the buff that ends games. When the Fire Giant is defeated it provides all players on a team with a huge increase to damage, and regen, as well as damage to structures. \n*****\nThe other camps are the Harpy camps. The one that mirrors the Fire Giant is a Golden Harpy (Refered as the Gold Fury in game) that provides a HUGE amount of gold to the team that defeats it. This is the objective that most early and mid game team fights revolve around.\n\nThe Grey Harpy camps are quickly respawning sources of Gold and Experience for whomever clears it. The middle ones are considered a small objective, and teams will likely be fighting over them every time they respawn.\n\nThe respawn rates for these camps are 5 minutes for the Fire Giant and Gold Fury. 4 Minutes for the rest of the buffs, 3 minutes for the middle harpies, and 2 minutes for harpies nearest to each base. \n\n**The Meta**\n\nFor those newer to MOBA style games there is generally something reffered to as 'The Meta' which simply means : \"What strategy are people using to win the match\". It generally discusses how many gods to a lane, do we use a jungler, and which gods go where.\n\nSmite uses a 2 - 1 - 1 - Jungler type setup. The long lane gets a Support (Guardian/Warrior) and a Carry (Hunter/Few Mages). The middle lane is almost exclusively Mages. The Short Lane gets a Solo Laner (Warrior/Mages/Few Assassins) and the Jungler who will spend most of the game killing Jungle Camps (Almost always an Assassins, few mages/warriors).\n\nThis setup allows for a few things, and these will be things you want to watch out for. \n\nThe Long Lane (The Duo Lane) : \n\nThis lane exists because the Support will help the Hunter who is generally weak early on get on his feet. You can expect every 3 minutes the Support Player to leave to help the Mid Lane and the Jungler to fight over the Mid Harpies. Be on the lookout for the Hunter to be crazy Late Game (20+ Minutes in).\n\nThe Mid Lane :\n\nThe mid lane is going to be about two mages fighting eachother for minion farm. Expect them to clear the minions quickly and to be looking for chances to rotate to the side lanes for surprise kills. They will also be with the support and jungler every three minutes fighting over mid harpies.\n\nThe Solo Lane :\n\nThis is generally referred to as 'Solo Island'. Most of the time this lane will result in few kills and be mostly a farm lane. The only time Solo Laners leave is to fight over the 'main' objectives such as tower pushes, Gold Fury, or even Fire Giant. \n\nThe Jungle :\n\nThe jungler has the role of farming the jungle for his experience as well as providing support and ganks (rotating to lanes to try to get kills) for his team. They provide uncertainty for the enemy team as he might be anywhere. Expect him to be at every major objective as well as every mid harpies.\n*****\nA standard match with each team taking one of the mid harpy camps, getting blue for their Hunter and Solo laner, and for one of the junglers (the one on the 'chaos' side of the map) their Speed Buff. After that players will be looking for chances to get farm and get kills in lane. Every Three Minutes expect to see some people head back to the Mid Harpies to fight over them. This is where you generally see 'First Blood' (First Blood is the first death in the game, and this provides large bonus to whomever gets it).\n\nAs the early game comes to a close (8-12 Minutes) you can expect to see towers start falling, teams begin grouping for Gold Fury, and this is where you will see one team likely begin to take a lead (Although there are lots of ways for teams to come back as long as a lead doesn't get too big.).\n\nThe Mid Game is about really looking to continue accruing a lead through Gold Furies, Towers, Kills, and stealing farm away from the opposing team by taking Jungle Camps. This phase of the game is all about putting a team in a great position to take Fire Giant. Fire Giants will generally occur towards the end of Mid Game (18-22 Minutes) and after a fight where one team kills most of the other team.\n\nThe Late Game is really anything past 22 Minutes, and is denoted when everyone has most of their core items built, Inner Towers are getting pressured hard, and fights end with many deaths rather than one or two. Expect the game to end on one team getting a large win.\n\nThis is very much a simplified version of how a match can go, and some games can even go on for as long as 45+ Minutes, but this gives a solid road map to follow.\n\n**The Gods**\n\nI am not going to cover every god but I will give not on a few you are likely going to see in each role.\n*****\n**Thor** : Jungler - Very High Damage and Mobility, Thor's ultimate is incredibly game changing. He can fly into the air and crash down on a location relatively far away from his take off location. This gives him the power to be everywhere and engage fights and because of this he is picked by a lot of teams. http://smite.gamepedia.com/Thor\n\n**Ra** : Mage (Solo/Mid) - High Damage, Long Range, Healer, Ra has a few things going for him. Good wave clear, a strong early game, a heal for his team that will make extended engagements goes in his favor, and an ultimate that is both great at engaging fights and picking off stragglers. http://smite.gamepedia.com/Ra\n\n**Apollo** : Hunter (Duo Lane) - Mobile, Hard To Kill, Late Game Carry, Apollo is probably the strongest Hunter in the game at the moment. His Ultimate will allow him to fly around the map getting to any teamfight he needs to, he can dash and CC enemies, and his passive allows him to put out the pain late game. Expect to see him picked or banned most of the time. http://smite.gamepedia.com/Apollo\n\n**Vamana** : Warrior (Solo Lane) - Tanky, Hard to Stop, Vamana can charge into fights, become a Giant and then begin smashing into the enemy teams backline with little an enemy team can do about it. His ultimate gives him a lot of damage in an AoE and if Vamana isn't stopped early this can destroy the late game. Vamana almost always makes a large splash at LANs. http://smite.gamepedia.com/Vamana\n\n**Geb** : Guardian (Duo Lane) - Fast, Lots of CC, Cleanse, Geb is probably the top support right now (Next to Sylvanus http://smite.gamepedia.com/Sylvanus). Not only is he fast at getting around the map as he can roll to any location he needs to, but he provides a low cooldown knockup (the strongest CC), a shield that breaks CC for his allies, but a very powerful initiating Ultimate. While he can't do much on his own, in a team he can quickly skew a fight in his favor. http://smite.gamepedia.com/Geb\n\n**Other Gods to Note**\nhttp://smite.gamepedia.com/Janus - Mage (Solo/Mid)\n\nhttp://smite.gamepedia.com/Hercules - Warrior (Solo)\n\nhttp://smite.gamepedia.com/Rama - Hunter (Duo)\n\nhttp://smite.gamepedia.com/Anhur - Hunter (Duo)\n\nhttp://smite.gamepedia.com/Scylla - Mage (Mid)\n\nhttp://smite.gamepedia.com/Zhong_Kui - Mage (Solo/Mid)\n\nhttp://smite.gamepedia.com/Sylvanus - Guardian (Duo)\n\nhttp://smite.gamepedia.com/Serqet - Assassin (Jungle)\n\nhttp://smite.gamepedia.com/Loki - Assassin (Jungle/Solo)\n\nhttp://smite.gamepedia.com/Aphrodite - Mage (Solo)\n\n**Items To Note**\n\nMost items are character Specific and for that I am going to defer to the casting and analysts of the event to go over most of them but a few things to note for new players.\n\n* Boots are very quick to be bought on all characters. They provide mobility and a good chunk of damage.\n* Actives in this game as abilities you can purchase and are incredibly strong.\n\nJunglers and Supports are going to rush buying an active called Hand Of The Gods at the start of the game. This allows them to clear jungle camps and minions easily. Why this is super important to note is that when the game progresses to the mid game all Support players will have this item at Rank 3. This allows them to 'execute' the Gold Fury and Fire Giant, and without it a team essentially can not risk attempting those objectives unless everyone is dead, as it might be stolen.\n\nPurification Beads are the other active you will commonly see. Crowd Control in this game is very powerful, and not only does Beads allow you to break Crowd Control, but on Mages/Assassins it will lower your cooldowns by 5 seconds, allowing for some characters to destroy.\n\n**Ending Notes**\n\nI am hoping everyone enjoys the event, the entire staff has been working like crazy to ensure this event is a fantastic one, and the community out pour of support has been insane. \n\nFor further information or to look up more about the game on your own I would suggest http://smite.gamepedia.com/ as your go to source. It is community managed and has a LOT of information that can be helpful during the event.\n\nFor information about the event itself check out

Snowden himself believes that US agents want him murdered instead. In an exclusive interview conducted in hiding in Russia, Snowden discusses the threats he&amp;#39;s facing, the extent of the NSA surveillance of civilians in concert with Australian spies, and the commercial espionage he claims the US is engaged in. The interview is conducted by Hubert Seipel from the German public broadcaster NDR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: Hubert Seipel&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: Mr Snowden, did you sleep well the last couple of nights because I was reading that you asked for a kind of police protection? Are there any threats?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN, WHISTLEBLOWER: There are significant threats, but I sleep - I sleep very well. There was an article that came out in an online out let called Buzzfeed where they interviewed officials from the Pentagon, from the National Security Agency, and they gave them anonymity to be able to say what they wanted, and what they told the reporter was that they wanted to murder me. These individuals, and these are acting Government officials, they said they wanted - they would be happy, they would love to put a bullet in my head, to poison me as I was returning from the grocery store, and have me die in the shower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: But fortunately you&amp;#39;re still alive with us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN: Right, but I&amp;#39;m still alive, and I don&amp;#39;t lose sleep because I have done what I feel I needed to do, it was the right thing to do and I am not going to be afraid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: The greatest fear I have, and I quote you, regarding these disclosures is nothing will change, that was one of your greatest concerns at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN: What we saw initially in response to the revelations, sort of a circling of the wagons of Government around the National Security Agency. Instead of circling around the public, and protecting their rights, the political class circled around the security state, and protected their rights. What&amp;#39;s interesting is, though that was the initial response, since then we&amp;#39;ve seen a softening, we&amp;#39;ve seen the President acknowledge when he first said, &amp;quot;We have drawn the right balance, there are no abuses&amp;quot;, we have seen him and his officials admit there have been abuses, there have been thousands of violations of the National Security Agency and other agencies, and authorities every single year.\nEvery time you pick up the phone, dial a number, write an e-mail, make a purchase, travel on the bus carrying a cell phone, swipe a card somewhere, you leave a trace, and the Government has decided that it&amp;#39;s good idea to collect it all, everything, even if you&amp;#39;ve never been suspected of doing a crime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the Government would identify a suspect, they would go to a judge, they would say, &amp;quot;We suspect he&amp;#39;s committed this crime&amp;quot;, they would get a warrant and then they would be able to use the totality of their powers in pursuit of the investigation. Nowadays what we see is they want to apply the totality of their power in advance, prior to an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: You started this debate. Edward Snowden is in the meantime a household name for the whistleblower in the age of the Internet, you are working last summer for the NSA and during this time you collected secretly thousands of confidential documents, what was the decisive moment or was there a long period of time, or something happening, why did you do this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN: I would say sort of the breaking point, is seeing the director of National Intellegence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress. There&amp;#39;s no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who need to be able to trust it and regulate its actions. Seeing that really meant for me there was no going back. Beyond that, it was the creeping realisation that no-one else was going to do this. The public had a right to know about these programmes. The public had a right to know that which the Government is doing, in its name, and that which the Government is doing against the public. But neither of these things we were allowed to discuss. We were - even the wider body of our elected representatives were prohibited from knowing or discussing these programmes. That&amp;#39;s a dangerous thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#39;re on the inside, when you go into work every day, when you sit down at the desk, and you realise the power you have, you can wire-tap the President of the United States, you can wire-tap a federal judge, and if you do it carefully, no-one will ever know, because the only way the NSA discovers abuses are from self-reporting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: We&amp;#39;re not only talking of the NSA as far as this is concerned, there is a multi-lateral agreement for corporation amongst the services, and this alliance of intelligence operations is known as the Five Eyes, what agencies and countries belong to this alliance and what is its purpose?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN: The Five Eyes alliance is sort of an artefact of the post World War II era where the Anglophone countries are the major powers to co-operate and share the costs of intelligence gathering infrastructure. So we have the UK GCHQ, we have the US NSA, we have Canada&amp;#39;s C-Sec, we have the Australian Signals Intelligence Directorate, and we have New Zealand&amp;#39;s DSD. What the result of this was over decades and decades was sort of a supra-national intelligence organisation that doesn&amp;#39;t answer to the laws of its own country. One of the major programmes that faced abuse in the National Security Agency is what&amp;#39;s called Keyscore. It&amp;#39;s a search engine which allows them to look through all of the records they collect through worldwide, everyday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: What could you do if you could, so to speak, with this kind of instrument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN: You could read anyone&amp;#39;s e-mail in the world, anybody you have got e-mail address for, any website you can watch traffic to and from it. Any computer that an individual sits at - You can watch it. Any laptop that you&amp;#39;re tracking, you can follow it as it moves from place to place flout the world. It&amp;#39;s a one-stop shop for access to the NSA&amp;#39;s information. And what&amp;#39;s more, you can tag individuals using XKeyscore where, let&amp;#39;s say I saw you once, and I thought what you were doing was interesting, or you just have access that&amp;#39;s interesting to me, let&amp;#39;s say you work as a major German corporation, and I want access to that network, I can track your user name on a web site, on a forum somewhere, I can track your real name, I can track associations with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I can build what&amp;#39;s called a fingerprint which is network activity unique to you which means anywhere you go in the world, anywhere you try to sort of hide your online presence, hide your identity, the NSA can find you. And anyone who&amp;#39;s allowed to use this or what the NSA shares the software with, can do the same thing. It&amp;#39;s no secret that every country in the world has the data of their citizens in the NSA. Millions and millions and millions of data connections from Germans going about their daily lives talking on their cell phones, sending SMS messages, visiting websites, buying things online, all of this ends up at the NSA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: Does the NSA spy on Siemens, on Mercedes, on other successful German companies, for example, to prevail of the advantage of knowing what is going on in the scientific and economic world?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN: There&amp;#39;s no question that the US is engaged in economic spying. If there&amp;#39;s information at Siemens that they think would be beneficial to the national interests, not the national security of the United States, they&amp;#39;ll go after that information and they&amp;#39;ll take it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: If one looks to the little public data of your life, one discovers that you obviously wanted to join in May 2004 the Special Forces to fight in Iraq. What happened to your adventure then? Did you stay long with them or what happened to you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN: No, I broke my legs when I was in training and was discharge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: So it was a short adventure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: In 2007, the CIA stationed you with diplomatic cover Switzerland, why did you join the CIA?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN: In many ways I think it&amp;#39;s a continuation of trying to do everything I could to prosecute the public good in the most effective way, and it&amp;#39;s in line with the rest of my Government service. Where I tried to use my technical skills in the most difficult positions I could find in the world and the CIA offered that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: If you look back, Special Forces, CIA, NSA, it&amp;#39;s not actually a description of human rights activist or somebody who becomes a whistleblower. What happens to you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN: I think to tell the story, and that&amp;#39;s no matter how deeply an individual is embedded in the Government. No matter how faithful to the Government they are, no matter how strongly they believe in the causes of their Government as I did during the Iraq war, people can learn, people can discover the line between appropriate Government behaviour, and actual wrongdoing. And I think it became clear to me that that line had been crossed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: You worked for the NSA through a private contractor with the name - one of the big ones in the business, what is the advantage for the US Government or the CIA to work through a private contractor to outsource essential Government functions?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN: The problem there is you end up in a situation where Government policies are being influenced by private corporations who have interests that are completely divorced from the public good in mind. The result of that is what we saw at Booze Hamilton where you have private individuals who have access what the Government alleges were millions and millions of records that they could walk out the door with at any time, with no accountability, no oversight, the Government didn&amp;#39;t know they were gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: At the very end you understood e-ended up in Russia. Many in the intelligence community suspect you made a deal, classified material for asylum here in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN: The chief of the task force investigating me as recently as December said that their investigation had turned up no evidence or indications at all that I had any outside help or contact or made a deal of any kind to accomplish my mission. I worked alone, I didn&amp;#39;t need anybody&amp;#39;s help. I don&amp;#39;t have any ties to foreign Government. I&amp;#39;m not a spy for Russia or China or any other country for that matter. If I&amp;#39;m a traitor, who did I betray? I gave all my information to American public, journalists, who are reporting on American issues. If they see that treason, people need to consider what do they think they&amp;#39;re working for? The public is supposed to be their boss, not their enemy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: One of the reaction to the NSA snooping, is that countries like Germany are thinking to create national Internets, an attempt to force Internet companies to keep their data in their own country, and does this work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN: It&amp;#39;s not going to stop the NSA, let&amp;#39;s put it that way, the NSA goes where the data is. If the NSA can pull text messages out of a telecommunications networks in China, they can probably manage to get Facebook messages out of Germany. Ultimately the solution to that is not to stick everything in a walled garden. Although that does raise the level of sophistication and complexity of taking the information, it&amp;#39;s much better to simply secure the information internationally against everyone rather than playing let&amp;#39;s move the data. Moving the data isn&amp;#39;t fixing the problem. Securing the data is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: Obama asked the Russian President several times to extradite you but did not. It looks like you will stay for the rest of your life in Russia, how do you feel about Russia in that context and is there a solution to this problem?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN: I think it&amp;#39;s becoming increasingly clear that these leaks didn&amp;#39;t cause harm. In fact, they served the public good. Because of that, I think it will be very difficult to maintain sort of an on-going campaign of persecution against someone who the public agrees serves the public interest. I would welcome the opportunity to talk about how we can bring this to a conclusion that serves the interests of all parties. I think it&amp;#39;s clear there are times where what is lawful is distinct from what is rightful. There are times throughout history and it doesn&amp;#39;t take long for either an American or a German, to think about times in the history of their country where the law provided the Government to do things which were not right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REPORTER: President Obama at the very moment not quite convinced of that because he said you&amp;#39;re charged with three felonies, and I quote, if you, Edward Snowden, believe in what you did, you should go back to America, appear before the Court with a lawyer and make your case. Is this the solution?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN: It&amp;#39;s interesting because he mentions three felonies, what he doesn&amp;#39;t say is that the crimes that he&amp;#39;s charged me with are crimes that don&amp;#39;t allow me to make my case. They don&amp;#39;t allow me to defend myself in an open Court to the public and convince the jury that what I did was to their benefit. The espionage act was never intended - it&amp;#39;s from 1918, it was never intended to prosecute journalistic sources, people who are informing the newspapers about information that&amp;#39;s of public interest. It was intended for people who are selling documents in secret to foreign Governments, who were bombing bridges, who were sabotaging communications. Not people who were serving the public good. So it&amp;#39;s - I would say illustrative that the President would choose to say someone should face the music when he knows the music is a show trial.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reporter\nHubert Seipel&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Producers\nChristoph Mestmacher-Steiner\nDirk Neuhoff\nUlrich Lenze&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Director\nPatricia Schlesinger&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Camera\nKnut Sodemann\nArmin Ploger&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Camera Assistant\nMichael Menke&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Editor \nRainer Wolf&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Location Manager\nMoritz Widmann&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Produced by Cinecentrum and NDR&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;18th February 2014&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "http://www.ardmediathek.de/tv/ARD-Sondersendung/Edward-Snowden-exklusiv-Das-Interview/Das-Erste/Video?documentId=19287388&amp;bcastId=3304234\n\nhttp://media.ndr.de/progressive_geo/2014/0127/TV-20140127-1858-3042.lo.mp4\n\nhttp://www.liveleak.com/view?i=f93_1390833151\n\nhttp://www.sbs.com.au/news/dateline/story/snowden-speaks\n\nTranscript\n\nAs you heard in Mark Davis' story before the break, Christopher Boyce believes NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden faces decades in prison if he's ever captured and returned to America.

Edward Snowden is in the meantime a household name for the whistleblower in the age of the Internet, you are working last summer for the NSA and during this time you collected secretly thousands of confidential documents, what was the decisive moment or was there a long period of time, or something happening, why did you do this?\n\nEDWARD SNOWDEN: I would say sort of the breaking point, is seeing the director of National Intellegence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress. There's no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who need to be able to trust it and regulate its actions. Seeing that really meant for me there was no going back. Beyond that, it was the creeping realisation that no-one else was going to do this. The public had a right to know about these programmes. The public had a right to know that which the Government is doing, in its name, and that which the Government is doing against the public. But neither of these things we were allowed to discuss. We were - even the wider body of our elected representatives were prohibited from knowing or discussing these programmes. That's a dangerous thing.\n\nWhen you're on the inside, when you go into work every day, when you sit down at the desk, and you realise the power you have, you can wire-tap the President of the United States, you can wire-tap a federal judge, and if you do it carefully, no-one will ever know, because the only way the NSA discovers abuses are from self-reporting.\n\nREPORTER: We're not only talking of the NSA as far as this is concerned, there is a multi-lateral agreement for corporation amongst the services, and this alliance of intelligence operations is known as the Five Eyes, what agencies and countries belong to this alliance and what is its purpose?\n\nEDWARD SNOWDEN: The Five Eyes alliance is sort of an artefact of the post World War II era where the Anglophone countries are the major powers to co-operate and share the costs of intelligence gathering infrastructure. So we have the UK GCHQ, we have the US NSA, we have Canada's C-Sec, we have the Australian Signals Intelligence Directorate, and we have New Zealand's DSD. What the result of this was over decades and decades was sort of a supra-national intelligence organisation that doesn't answer to the laws of its own country. One of the major programmes that faced abuse in the National Security Agency is what's called Keyscore. It's a search engine which allows them to look through all of the records they collect through worldwide, everyday.\n\nREPORTER: What could you do if you could, so to speak, with this kind of instrument.\n\nEDWARD SNOWDEN: You could read anyone's e-mail in the world, anybody you have got e-mail address for, any website you can watch traffic to and from it. Any computer that an individual sits at - You can watch it. Any laptop that you're tracking, you can follow it as it moves from place to place flout the world. It's a one-stop shop for access to the NSA's information. And what's more, you can tag individuals using XKeyscore where, let's say I saw you once, and I thought what you were doing was interesting, or you just have access that's interesting to me, let's say you work as a major German corporation, and I want access to that network, I can track your user name on a web site, on a forum somewhere, I can track your real name, I can track associations with your friends.\n\nAnd I can build what's called a fingerprint which is network activity unique to you which means anywhere you go in the world, anywhere you try to sort of hide your online presence, hide your identity, the NSA can find you. And anyone who's allowed to use this or what the NSA shares the software with, can do the same thing. It's no secret that every country in the world has the data of their citizens in the NSA. Millions and millions and millions of data connections from Germans going about their daily lives talking on their cell phones, sending SMS messages, visiting websites, buying things online, all of this ends up at the NSA.\n\nREPORTER: Does the NSA spy on Siemens, on Mercedes, on other successful German companies, for example, to prevail of the advantage of knowing what is going on in the scientific and economic world?\n\nEDWARD SNOWDEN: There's no question that the US is engaged in economic spying. If there's information at Siemens that they think would be beneficial to the national interests, not the national security of the United States, they'll go after that information and they'll take it.\n\nREPORTER: If one looks to the little public data of your life, one discovers that you obviously wanted to join in May 2004 the Special Forces to fight in Iraq. What happened to your adventure then? Did you stay long with them or what happened to you?\n\nEDWARD SNOWDEN: No, I broke my legs when I was in training and was discharge.\n\nREPORTER: So it was a short adventure.\n\nEDWARD SNOWDEN: Yes.\n\nREPORTER: In 2007, the CIA stationed you with diplomatic cover Switzerland, why did you join the CIA?\n\nEDWARD SNOWDEN: In many ways I think it's a continuation of trying to do everything I could to prosecute the public good in the most effective way, and it's in line with the rest of my Government service. Where I tried to use my technical skills in the most difficult positions I could find in the world and the CIA offered that.\n\nREPORTER: If you look back, Special Forces, CIA, NSA, it's not actually a description of human rights activist or somebody who becomes a whistleblower. What happens to you?\n\nEDWARD SNOWDEN: I think to tell the story, and that's no matter how deeply an individual is embedded in the Government. No matter how faithful to the Government they are, no matter how strongly they believe in the causes of their Government as I did during the Iraq war, people can learn, people can discover the line between appropriate Government behaviour, and actual wrongdoing. And I think it became clear to me that that line had been crossed.\n\nREPORTER: You worked for the NSA through a private contractor with the name - one of the big ones in the business, what is the advantage for the US Government or the CIA to work through a private contractor to outsource essential Government functions?\n\nEDWARD SNOWDEN: The problem there is you end up in a situation where Government policies are being influenced by private corporations who have interests that are completely divorced from the public good in mind. The result of that is what we saw at Booze Hamilton where you have private individuals who have access what the Government alleges were millions and millions of records that they could walk out the door with at any time, with no accountability, no oversight, the Government didn't know they were gone.\n\nREPORTER: At the very end you understood e-ended up in Russia. Many in the intelligence community suspect you made a deal, classified material for asylum here in Russia.\n\nEDWARD SNOWDEN: The chief of the task force investigating me as recently as December said that their investigation had turned up no evidence or indications at all that I had any outside help or contact or made a deal of any kind to accomplish my mission. I worked alone, I didn't need anybody's help. I don't have any ties to foreign Government. I'm not a spy for Russia or China or any other country for that matter. If I'm a traitor, who did I betray? I gave all my information to American public, journalists, who are reporting on American issues. If they see that treason, people need to consider what do they think they're working for? The public is supposed to be their boss, not their enemy.\n\nREPORTER: One of the reaction to the NSA snooping, is that countries like Germany are thinking to create national Internets, an attempt to force Internet companies to keep their data in their own country, and does this work?\n\nEDWARD SNOWDEN: It's not going to stop the NSA, let's put it that way, the NSA goes where the data is. If the NSA can pull text messages out of a telecommunications networks in China, they can probably manage to get Facebook messages out of Germany. Ultimately the solution to that is not to stick everything in a walled garden. Although that does raise the level of sophistication and complexity of taking the information, it's much better to simply secure the information internationally against everyone rather than playing let's move the data. Moving the data isn't fixing the problem. Securing the data is the problem.\n\nREPORTER: Obama asked the Russian President several times to extradite you but did not. It looks like you will stay for the rest of your life in Russia, how do you feel about Russia in that context and is there a solution to this problem?\n\nEDWARD SNOWDEN: I think it's becoming increasingly clear that these leaks didn't cause harm. In fact, they served the public good. Because of that, I think it will be very difficult to maintain sort of an on-going campaign of persecution against someone who the public agrees serves the public interest. I would welcome the opportunity to talk about how we can bring this to a conclusion that serves the interests of all parties. I think it's clear there are times where what is lawful is distinct from what is rightful. There are times throughout history and it doesn't take long for either an American or a German, to think about times in the history of their country where the law provided the Government to do things which were not right.\n\nREPORTER: President Obama at the very moment not quite convinced of that because he said you're charged with three felonies, and I quote, if you, Edward Snowden, believe in what you did, you should go back to America, appear before the Court with a lawyer and make your case. Is this the solution?\n\nEDWARD SNOWDEN: It's interesting because he mentions three felonies, what he doesn't say is that the crimes that he's charged me with are crimes that don't allow me to make my case. They don't allow me to defend myself in an open Court to the public and convince the jury that what I did was to their benefit. The espionage act was never intended - it's from 1918, it was never intended to prosecute journalistic sources, people who are informing the newspapers about information that's of public interest. It was intended for people who are selling documents in secret to foreign Governments, who were bombing bridges, who were sabotaging communications. Not people who were serving the public good. So it's - I would say illustrative that the President would choose to say someone should face the music when he knows the music is a show trial.\n\nReporter\nHubert Seipel\n\nProducers\nChristoph Mestmacher-Steiner\nDirk Neuhoff\nUlrich Lenze\n\nDirector\nPatricia Schlesinger\n\nCamera\nKnut Sodemann\nArmin Ploger\n\nCamera Assistant\nMichael Menke\n\nEditor \nRainer Wolf\n\nLocation Manager\nMoritz Widmann\n\nProduced by Cinecentrum and NDR\n\n18th February 2014", "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "2r2llb", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sour_creme", "media": null, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh23", "edited": 1420175117.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "mod_reports": [], "saved": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_2r2llb", "permalink": "/r/test/comments/2r2llb/test/", "stickied": false, "created": 1420203059.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/test/comments/2r2llb/test/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Test", "created_utc": 1420174259.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 1, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.test", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "test", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201dBacon ipsum dolor amet do alcatra dolore corned beef salami, sed filet mignon in pastrami.
